Welcome to EE-Final-Project of an autonomous driving vehicle by Ori Cohen and Bar Elias.

The full project description is in our project's book, 
so if you would like some more details about it feel free to ask (assuming you are a recureter :) or we know each other and have each other's contacts details).

In short, our project focuses in making a self-driving vehicle that can follow a track with 2 white lines on the sides,
and also pay attention to traffic lights, stop signs, and obstacles on the way and takes actions accordingly.
We use image processing, Machine learning, and Master-Slave approach with Arduino-uno and Raspberry pi 4.
